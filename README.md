## Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website.

I used it as a project to get familiar with NextJS and Tailwind.

I tried to copy the style of Tokyo Metro, I found that copying a design language is good practice when learning new tools (in this case, Tailwind)

### Tools
- NextJs
- Tailwind
- Framer motion
- React icons
